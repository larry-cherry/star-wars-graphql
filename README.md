# React Native 
This app uses the star wars graphql api by [star-wars-swapi@current](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/star-wars-swapi/home?variant=current).
The Github for the api can be located [here](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql). The goal of this project is to learn how to use graphql in React Native projects and build an entertaining app in the process.
